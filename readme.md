This assignment is more for the logging aspect of the site. 
I can tell you that the logging information is working correctly and the files are 
generated as shown. However, I have an issue where the folder itself isn't being created 
although the code is correct as the files themselves use the same functions to create the files. I would have to dig a little deeper in why it isn't making the folder on first request but for now the files are generating.

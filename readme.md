This Project is simply having a user register an account on the site, 
log in, if they are admins they are allowed to manage other users and 
upload a music related CSV. 

Things that could be improved for later but was not required:
* Force the user to upload only CSVs
* Have the song maybe lead to a YouTube video of that song
